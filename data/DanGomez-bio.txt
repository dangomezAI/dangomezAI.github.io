Daniel J. Gomez is a computational molecular biologist with expertise in tropical medicine, medical microbiology, pharmacology, and neurovirology. His research integrates computational tools with spatial, structural, chemical, and systems biology to advance precision medicine.

Gomez's current work focuses on computational exercise molecular biology, utilizing multi-view advanced spatial genomics and spectral spatial clustering to explore cellular diversity. His ultimate goal is to bridge biological research and clinical applications to improve patient outcomes through biotechnology and bioengineering.

As a clinical computational scientist, he is focused on genetics, computational cancer systems biology, and exercise immunology. His collaborative thesis project with CSUEB and Stanford University aims to map exercise-induced exerkines across organs. By integrating multi-omics datasets from preclinical models and humans, he analyzes how these molecules function within tissue microenvironments and cellular networks. This research seeks to provide insights into how exerkines can prevent, manage, and treat diseases, ultimately contributing to precision medicine and predicting health outcomes.

Pursuing a Master of Science in Biological Sciences, his research interests include exercise immunology, computational systems biology, genetics, and spatially resolved multi-omics. He is dedicated to advancing medicine and patient care through translational research. In his personal time, he prioritizes physical and mental well-being through exercise, art, and mindfulness.
